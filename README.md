# hello-world
This is my first repository which I created to practice how the workflow on GitHub is. I made this using the 'hello-world' GitHub Guide.
I will use this repository for miscellaneous stuff, such as to store ideas, resources etc.
My name is Sanya Swain and I am very new to the world of Open Source. I hope to work on meaningful projects in the near future.
